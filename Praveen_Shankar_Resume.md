**Software Development Engineer I (SDE-1)** | *2019 – 2022* (Organizational Re-leveling)
*Focus: Orchestration, Observability & Platform Security*

*   **Resource Orchestration:** Evolved **MoveService** into a resilient resource allocation engine. Migrated legacy delete-based persistence to immutable update patterns for improved auditability.
*   **Operational Automation:** Built **PickAdmin**, a configuration-driven service using the **Kubernetes Java SDK** to automate dynamic CronJobs, **eliminating manual support interventions**.
*   **Operational Efficiency:** Delivered the **"Tray Identifier"** capability, a critical feature that enhanced physical inventory tracking and reduced lost units in stores.
*   **Security Compliance:** Led the platform-wide migration of sensitive configuration credentials to **Kubernetes Secrets**, achieving **100% security compliance**.

**Principal Software Engineer** | *2016 – 2019*
*Focus: Platform Migration & Algorithm Optimization*

*   **Founding FPS Team:** Designed the **Logistic Unit Service** from scratch, applying **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** to handle complex trolley inventory workflows at scale.
*   **Legacy Modernization:** Championed the transition from legacy .NET monoliths to distributed Java microservices, introducing cloud-native patterns (Event Sourcing, CQRS).
*   **Route Optimization:** Integrated the **"Topaz" Simulated Annealing algorithm** (G2), leveraging exact coordinate distance matrices to optimize picker travel time.
*   **Device Integration:** Built **Delivery Service** and **PickTrip Service** to support the rollout of new handheld devices for General Merchandise workflows.

**Senior Software Engineer** | *2013 – 2016*
*Focus: Performance Engineering & Monolith Componentization*

*   **System Decoupling:** Executed the strategic componentization of the legacy **DMS monolith**, isolating the "Picking Component" to enable independent scaling.
*   **Performance Engineering:** Designed the **PickTrip Buffer Management** system to throttle workflow load during peak windows (5:00 AM), preventing database bottlenecks.
*   **Optimization Logic:** Implemented **"On-Demand Picktrip Generation"**, capable of evaluating complex multi-variable constraints (Weight, Volume, Van Sequence) in real-time.
