Please review the following areas and fill in the placeholders with your best estimates.

## 1. Professional Summary
*   **Current:** "...capable of 99.99% availability and massive scale."
*   **Need:** Define "massive scale".
    *   *Volume:* "handling **[X] million** events per day"
    *   *Throughput:* "processing **[Y]k** orders per hour during peak"
    *   *Value:* "supporting **£[Z] billion** in annual revenue"

## 2. Micro-Fulfilment (MFC) Architect (2022–Present)
*   **Current:** "Leading the architectural analysis... targeting 99.99% availability."
*   **Need:** What was the improvement?

## 4. Operational Automation (PickAdmin)
*   **Current:** "...eliminating manual support interventions."
*   **Need:** Quantify the toil reduction.
    *   *Hours Saved:* "Saving **[X]** engineering hours per week by automating manual CronJob config."
    *   *Response Time:* "Reduced store support turnaround from **days to minutes**."

## 5. Route Optimization (2016–2019)
*   **Current:** "Integrated the 'Topaz' Simulated Annealing algorithm..."
*   **Need:** The business result.
    *   *Travel Time:* "Reduced average picker walk distance by **[X]%**."
    *   *Cost:* "Estimated annual operational savings of **£[Y]m**."

## 6. Performance Engineering (2013–2016)
*   **Current:** "...preventing database bottlenecks."
*   **Need:** The load handled.
    *   *Peak Load:* "Stabilized system under **[X]x** normal load during 5:00 AM peak."
    *   *Database:* "Reduced database CPU utilization by **[Y]%** during batch windows."
